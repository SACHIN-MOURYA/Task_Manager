# Task Management Application

## Objective

Straight forward task management application that focuses on core functionality and a user-friendly interface.

## Core Features

### Dashboard
- Upon accessing the application, users see a basic dashboard displaying a list of tasks.
- The dashboard includes sections for:
  - **Upcoming Tasks**

- Each task includes the following attributes:
  - **Title**: Brief name or label for the task.
  - **Description**: Detailed information or notes about the task.
  - **Due Date**: Date by which the task should be completed.
  - **Priority Level**: Importance level for each task.

### Priority Levels
- Define three priority levels for tasks:
  - **High**
  - **Medium**
  - **Low**
- Users can set and update the priority of each task based on urgency or importance.

### Search and Filter
